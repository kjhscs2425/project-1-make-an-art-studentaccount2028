# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like

I want my drawing to be of a dog.

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

I want to use a variable called thickness so I can adjust the pen thickness throughout my drawing. I also want to set a color variable so that I can periodically change the color. 


3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?

The repetition will be in the squares and different shapes that I draw such as triangles and circles. 


4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

I think that the main parts of my drawing are the face shape, the inner parts of the face such as the mouth and nose, and the exterior parts right below the face such as the color with maybe even a name on it. 


5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

A loop variable can be used for drawing shapes. The squares or circles may have a different dimmensions every time, and surely will have different locations.
